      <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          A general understanding of fighting game mechanics.
        </li>
        <li>Knowledge on how a gacha game system works.</li>
        <li>
          Basic understanding on RPG progression systems.

    <header>How to get EXP</header>
    <article>
      <ul>
        <li>There are three ways to get EXP: Stories (or Dailies if you want                 moves as well as EXP), Prize Fights, and power up sacrificing.
        </li>
        <li>It is not recommended to use Power Up. Fighters are much more costly              to obtain than a bit of EXP. Each fighter costs 100 Theonite, and                they can be leveled for Skill Points which are valuable in powering              up your main fighters.
        </li>
        <li>As you get more comfortable fighting out of your FS, getting EXP will be easier. The stronger your opponents are the more EXP you'll be able to get from them.
        </li>
        <li>Repeating story missions will now grant EXP, so when you are stuck, try to find one you can longshot easily and play that one when you want to get levels.
        </li>
        <li>Repeating dailies will not grant bonus EXP, so unless you want to try to get a move, your time is usually better spent elsewhere.
        </li>
        <li>EXP boosters can be obtained from gifts, so try to make friends and exchange gifts with them as often as you can.

    <header>What to do with fighters</header>
    <article>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Favorite at least one of each variant whenever you get them. While duplicates are not likely to be invested in early on, making sure you keep one of everything around will help in the long run when you better understand what is and is not good, and you never know if you need a specific fighter for a story node.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you want to see who's the best fighter, check out the frequently updated Tier List and see who in your collection people consider the strongest.
        </li>
        <li>
          Even a bad Diamond, Gold, and Silver is worth using early on. Each level will raise their stats higher than a lower rarity fighter, and some nodes will require you to have specific rarities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Diamonds can carry with their natural stats, but do not pour invest in them too much early on. You can upgrade several fighters of lower rarities for the same cost and get more use out of them. Several story missions lock you to rarity as well, so this is important to do.
        </li>
        <li>
          Feel free to use your favorites, even if they are not top tier. The entire story can be beaten with any character so long as you build them and play well.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep at least one strong Bronze and Silver around for the Bronze and Silver Prize Fights and story nodes that limit you to certain rarities.
        </li>
        <li>
          While the ideal order to upgrade fighters varies by fighter, a popular order is Signature Ability, Moves, Attack, Defense, and Energy. To simply see if you enjoy how a fighter plays, just unlock the beginning of their Signature Ability.

    <header>What to do with moves</header>
    <article>
            <ul>
        <li>
          Get moves to level 3 to unlock their effect. Moves that inflict BLEED are excellent to have early on, as BLEED deals a % of the opponent's HP which lets you fight out of your range if you can defend well.
        </li>
        <li>
          When you have multiple moves, check the stats to see which is the best to upgrade. ATK, Meter Gain, Defense, and HP% are safe stats to have in a move, with other stats varying based on what variant you use.
        </li>
        <li>
          Leveling moves past 3 usually isn't worth it unless the stats are very good. The coin cost goes up drastically, and it can get too expensive for the benefit for only one fighter.
        </li>
      </ul>

  <section class="main-section" id="RESOURCES">
    <header>How to earn and spend Coins and Theonite</header>
    <article>
            <ul>
        <li>
          There is a variety of ways to earn Theonite, including Stories, Prize Fights, and Missions that refresh daily.
        </li>
        <li>
          For Theonite missions, be realistic about what you can do and how much you want to play. That 25 Theo from Longshot might seem tempting, but it is okay to reroll it if you are not skilled enough to pull it off. It is better to have 5 Theonite that' is easy to get, than 25 you cannot get.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you have a bookworm or longshot mission but you are stuck on story, replaying a node you already beat still counts towards the mission (and you get all the exp from it, but only 20% of the coins)
        </li>
        <li>
          Don't be afraid to try advanced and expert stories. Many of them are easier than the later basic stories, and they give a decent chunk of Theonite and coins.
        </li>
        <li>
          Focus on premier 10+1 while starting out. While the starters are not amazing, they are more than enough to get 1k Theo. The bonus relic has ~2x better odds for a Silver and Gold fighter, so it gives you the best odds of getting a strong Silver/Gold fighter early on. The Silver from the 7 day bonus will also be a big help if you prefer going slow and steady.
        </li>
        <li>
          From Monday-Saturday, you will see three Prize Fights that feature a specific character, ranging from Bronze tier to Gold tier. Look at the modifiers and conditions for these PFs, and use these to get some extra coins and Theo as well as EXP.
        </li>
        <li>
          On Weekends, you will see two unique Prize Fights, Show Me Your Moves! and one that cycles between different elements. Neither of these are amazing early on, but Show Me Your Moves! can give you access to a few extra moves and coins. It is less reliable than dailies, but it is another option you can use for moves and another source of coins.
        </li>
        <li>
          Also, look out for Medici Prize Fights. They are, by far, the best way to gain coins in the game. There are two kinds: one that appears one random day for a day, and one that appears Wednesdays and Saturdays.
        </li>

    <header>What's an MA? How do you unlock Marquee Abilities?</header>
    <article>
            <ul>
        <li>
          MAs or Marquee Abilities are powerful traits that you can use to customize your fighter.
        </li>
        <li>
          To unlock them, simply unlock the ENTIRE skill tree of a fighter. You will then be able to choose 2 powerful traits and unlock one if you have enough coins and skill points.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can always choose to swap your Marquee Abilities if you have enough skill points.
        </li>

  <section class="main-section" id="MODS">
    <header>Where can I see a list of modifiers in the game?</header>
    <article>
            <ul>
        <li>
          Modifiers are BUFF and DEBUFFS that adds complexity and dynamic in a fight. They are often an integral part of a fighter's Signature or Marquee Ability. A list of modifiers in the game can be found here.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fight Modifiers are special features that have a impact on the course of a fight. They may benefit either, your team or the opponent's, or both. They are present in almost all Daily Events, Prize Fights and Origin Stories.

  <section class="main-section" id="RIFT">
    <header>What is Rift?</header>
    <article>
            <ul>
        <li>
          Rift Battles is a competitive game mode where players fight each other's base with powerful fight modifiers that can be supplemented with Catalysts for building impenetrable defenses. Although it is a competitive game mode, new players are highly encouraged to start playing Rifts early not to play competitively but to reap the weekly rewards that are given for playing a minimum of five times in a week. These rewards contain highly valuable resources that will help new players to improve and build their roster fast.
